# Brief

  This document is helped me to record my learning when coding.
  coding stuff is plenty. By doing this method, I would like to implement
  more about this fatasic things. Because there is many tutorial on the net,
  I am going to coding and record in "blocks". It would be a better way to 
  abosorb lots of information.

# C/C++ basics
1. bitwise_operation
2. thread
3. sequential_containers
* DataType, 
* PointArray, 
* Vector, 
* Quene,
* Design Pattern,
* Linked-List
